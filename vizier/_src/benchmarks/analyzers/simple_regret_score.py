  """Computes the one-sided T-test score.

  In case of a maximization (minimizatoin) problem, it scores the confidence
  that the mean of 'baseline_mean_values' is less (greater) than the mean of
  'candidate_mean_values'.

  The lower the score the higher the confidence that it's the case.

  One-sample
  ----------
  The test assumes t-distribution with mean given by 'candidate' and compute
  the probability of observing sample mean of 'baseline' or less.

  Two-sample
  ----------
  The test assumes 'baseline' and 'candidate' have the same mean and computes
  the probability that the 'baseline' sample mean is less than the 'candidate'
  sample mean.

  The lower the T-test p-value score the more confidence we have that
  'candidate' is indeed "better" than 'baseline'.

  Arguments:
    baseline_mean_values: List of baseline simple regret values.
    candidate_mean_values: List of candidate simple regret values.
    objective_goal: The optimization problem type (MAXIMIZE or MINIMIZE).

  Returns:
    The p-value score of the one-sided T test.
