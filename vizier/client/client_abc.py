"""Cross-platform Vizier client interfaces.

Code written using these interfaces are compatible with OSS and Cloud Vertex
Vizier. Note importantly that subclasses may have more methods than what is
required by interfaces, and such methods are not cross compatible. Our
recommendation is to use type annotatations of `StudyInterface` or
`TrialInterface` wherever applicable.

#Materialize: The method returns a deep copy of the underlying pyvizier object.
Modifying the returned object does not update the Vizier service.
