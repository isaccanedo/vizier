        "TFP [bijectors](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/tree/main/tensorflow_probability/python/bijectors) represent (mostly) invertible, smooth functions. For Bayesopt modeling in Vizier, they are used to:\n",
        "- to constrain parameter values for optimization in an unconstrained space.\n",
        "- For input warping or output warping (e.g. the [Yeo Johnson](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.yeojohnson.html) bijector).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each bijector implements at least 3 methods:\n",
        "  * `forward`,\n",
        "  * `inverse`, and\n",
        "  * (at least) one of `forward_log_det_jacobian` and `inverse_log_det_jacobian`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When bijectors are used to transform distributions (with `tfd.TransformedDistribution`), the log det Jacobian ensures that the transformation is volume-preserving and the distribution's PDF still integrates to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bijectors also cache the forward and inverse computations, and log-det-Jacobians. This has two purposes:\n",
        "- Avoid repeating potentially expensive computations (as with the `CholeskyOuterProduct` bijector).\n",
        "- Maintain numerical precision so that `b.inverse(b.forward(x)) == x`.\n",
        "Below is an illustration of preservation of numerical precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although TFP library bijectors are written in TensorFlow (and automatically converted to JAX with TFP's rewrite machinery), user-defined bijectors can be written in JAX directly. For example, a complete JAX reimplementation of the `Exp` bijector is below. TFP's library already contains an `Exp` bijector and it's JAX supported, so it isn't actually necessary to implement this.\n",
        "\n",
        "While it's rare that Vizier users will have to implement new TFP components, we include this as an example to show how it would be done using TFP's JAX backend, since all TFP library bijectors are written in TensorFlow."
